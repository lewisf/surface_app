# Surface App

A bare bones Surface boilerplate without any node/npm dependencies, i.e., no babel, no webpack required!

## Getting started

  * git clone `git@github.com:msaraiva/surface_app.git`
  * Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

That's all!
